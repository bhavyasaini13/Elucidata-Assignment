Assignment based on Gene expression analysis for Pancreatic Cancer.

Introduction: Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is the third most common cause of death from cancer, with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 5%, and is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States by 2030. RNA sequencing is used to check the amount of RNA in a given biological sample. I had a dataset conatining 18,465 genes and 183 tumor samples, in GCT format which had 3 dataframes combined together. 

1. Main dataframe which has 18465 genes and 183 samples.
2. Row metadata which has 18465 gene names only.
3. Column metadata which has 183 sample names and 124 rows of metadata like patient id, vital status, histological type, ethinicity etc.
